<h1>
Azure Data Platform Learning Resources
</h1>

* Build a list of Azure Data Platform Resources they said.
* Put it on github they said.
* Make it so that the community can contribute they said.
* Do all this in your spare time they said.

OK.

This will become more formal with time, but for the moment, here's our goal:

This GitHub repository represents a listing of Azure Data Platform Learning Resources. It's meant to provide as many people as possible with the tools and resources needed to get started working with the Microsoft Azure Data Platform. The resources are contributed by the community, the instructors, and anyone with an interest in improving the knowledge and learning around the Azure Data Platform.

Please feel free to issue pull requests with additional information. I am currently maintaining this entirely on my own, so please don't expect quick responses (I have an actual job too).
